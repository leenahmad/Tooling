## Database design and the wireframe

*Database design* we use local storage to save items information like name coffee(string), quantity(integer), type(string), price(integer) in local storage saves how much user order items and we save it and we can take it again. 
And save price total(integer) for item, subtotal(integer) and delivery price (integer)save in local storage

so here in activity diagram 


## Coding and implementation 
technique

 we use *Agile* technique 

So, the agile focuses on
certain characteristics, 
implemented in a short time and 
presented to the customer (the customer), here the customer (the customer) can see more how his idea was implemented, and we can see his reaction when seeing the product, if there are modifications or changes, it can be easily and quickly to do it, and then move to a next property until the project is fully built.
In general, the customer (the customer) cannot express his idea and exactly what he wants from the beginning, he has an idea, an explanation of his idea and how he imagines the software, but how to implement it and the characteristics he wants remains blurry until he sees a product with his own eyes, to be able to evaluate whether this is what he wants or not.
So, the Agile depends on providing real primary products during successive periods of time to the customer (the customer), which the customer (the customer) can try and evaluate and give the existing comments or errors, and therefore it is easy to overcome these errors or observations because you are in an early stage of work, and you can progress To the next step with greater steadfastness and completion of the next version by adding some features and characteristics until the project is completed.
