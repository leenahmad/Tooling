# Tooling

# Stage 1 
## Task1.1
# Virtual Studio Code
The code editor, Virtual Studio Code, is one of the most important editors for writing code. The editor is produced by Microsoft, which is rich in definition. Of course, the editor supports many descriptive languages such as HTML, CSS, XML, and also supports programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, Java, c#, C++, PHP and others. , the program acquires the largest community to support the program with the best of the many and distinctive additions that make it easier for the programmer to complete his projects better and faster through a set of privileges provided by the editor through additions, which actually saves a lot of time, the program has become a strong competitor to giant editors such as Atom, Sublime Text , or even PyCharm , NetBeans .
You can use the Visual Studio Code program in the field of front-end web design, and you can also use it for programming in JavaScript or PHP, and there are many extensions for each language. The program offers you everything you need and wish to help you write the code in one program, we will review with you the most important and best additions that you will need to start using the editor professionally.
And VS code contain a lot of thing like 
- Adding vs live share helps you share the project with your friends to read the code and modify it
- The vs live share whitebaard addition is based on the previous addition that provides you with a blackboard with your friends to write on and explain on it what you want in shapes, drawings and writing
- Adding vs live share Audio, the sequel to the previous two additions, to share the project with your friends
- Add Bracket pair colorizer This add-on puts colors around the beginning and end of the brackets, a beautiful addition
- Adding Live Server, which is the add-on that I like the most in the visual studio code editor. Its role is that when you write html codes and want to try them in any browser, you exit the code until you see the result, and this add-on opens a browser for you with the code, you program and you see the result at the same time
Css Preview is also an add-on that enables you to see the changes that occur on the page without having to leave the editor
- Adding Css Peek, its role, takes you directly to the css of the class you chose, meaning when you write html codes and add a Css class to it whenever you want to add anything to this class, you click on it and the tool takes you directly to its css and add what you want
# PyCharm
It is integrated development environment(IDE) to use for computer programming, and pyCharm for programming in Python language , as it was specifically designed for the Python language and all its branches such as (Django) and others. It is very different from other software environments; Because it was developed specifically for python programmers, it was produced and developed by the Czech company JetBrains, a company known for developing many development environments; This indicates the strength of this environment for its users.
Downloading the PyCharm is very important for any Python programmer; Because it provides an ideal work environment that enables the programmer to complete his tasks in that easy and wonderful programming language, where the program comes with high and wonderful specifications that cover the programmer's need and also comes with all the necessary tools, as it calls all the files and libraries of the language and makes it easier for the programmer to search It gives him all the suggestions for the word he wants to type or search for, giving the icon to search for files, tools and all that is needed, and it supports all types of databases.

# Linux 
Linux is an open-source code based on Unix, multitasking, and multiuser operating system that was built by a guy named Linus Torvalds with the help of many programmers around the world, because a lot of students loved working on the Unix environment, but because its high cost they could not buy it to work on it at home, so I came up with the idea of making a miniature and similar version or the so-called clone for Linux by Linus. Of course, he built the kernel or the so-called kernel for the system only, and after that the programs of the GNU company were integrated on it and it became in its various distributions that are currently on the Internet in all its forms, such as Red Hat, Debian and many others.
Because Linux is an open operating system, its development is done collaboratively, meaning that no single company is solely responsible for developing or supporting a Linux system. The companies that share the economic share of Linux share the costs of research and development with their partners and competitors. Thus, the distribution of the development burden for the Linux system between companies and individuals contributed positively to the creation of a large and effective development environment and a lot of unannounced software innovations.
# Windows 
The Windows operating system is a computer operating system developed by Microsoft with the aim of operating personal computers, and it is an operating system that includes the first user interface type GUI for computers, and is compatible with IBM, and currently the Windows operating system dominated the computer market, where versions of Windows are used 90%.
It can store files, run programs, watch videos, connect to the Internet, and many other things. Some may think that it only works on PCs, but this belief is wrong as it works on mobile phones (until a few years ago at least) and on servers, and there is a version for the Xbox gaming platform.
Microsoft released the first version of Windows in the mid-1980s, but it was not a complete system at the time, but rather an extension of Microsoft's MS-DOS system. Since that time Microsoft has developed and improved its system to outperform all other systems. Currently, the latest version of Windows for PC is Windows 10 and the latest version for mobile phones is Windows Phone 10.



# GitHub
In order to be able to understand the GitHub site, we must first understand the name. The name is divided into two parts: Git-Hub and Git is a technique used to manage versions and joint work on programming projects or code in general. As for Hub, its literal translation is the main center, which is meant here as the assembly center for these versions, In a previous article on Git, Learn Git, we talked about an easy and simple way to share your projects and work with colleagues.
And back to GitHub, after we got acquainted with Git technology, you will find that your projects that you have shared using Git technology will need a place to stay, and here comes GitHub’s role. GitHub is a site for collecting posts and projects that are made using Git technology, and in fact, you cannot upload A project directly to GitHub, but you have to have created the project on your own device and then uploaded it - via the command line or custom programs - to your GitHub account.
It is a site where open-source projects are shared with everyone and the ability to modify them also. It is a repository done through Git. GitHub is used to store codes or codes and the projects you work on. You can also make the repository visible to everyone so that they can download and modify files, or you can make it personal. Just.
It is a Git hosting service, where we can upload repositories. And share it over the Internet instead of being saved locally in the computer only as open source or privately.
# GitLab
GIT is an open-source distributed version control system that can effectively solve from a small version to a very large project. So, it is a tool for managing project versions.
 Gitlab is an open-source project using a repository management system, with GIT as the code management tool, and web services built on that foundation. Simply put, Gitlab is the same as GitHub, which is used to store the project's repository.


## Task1.2
So, I use for my project Visual Studio Code(VS Code) as integrated development environment(IDE), I use Linux as operating system(OS) and GitHub as Version-control platform.

Here I will talk about the advantages for VScode, Linux and GitHub.

### Advantages for VScode 
-	Intelligent Sense Features
-	Correct mistakes
-	Built-in portal
-	Real-time appearance and color scheme preview
-	Terminal command line tool icon
-	Plugins that make VS Code easier to use

### Advantages for Linux 
-	Windows can support all types of the hard hardware
-	Windows operating system is easy to use
-	Windows supports software
-	Windows systems are the best environment for video game enthusiasts:
-	Windows systems can identify the hard hardware automatically, quickly and easily (such as the mouse, keyboard, game grip and camera), so the user only has to connect what he wants without the need to install it manually.
### advantages for GitHub
-	Github have a repository to save all files that contain the project and we can access using URL 
-	GitHub have a Forking. Can create a new project that based on other project and you can create your own branch and make changes on the project 
-	Social networking: Social networking in GitHub is probably the most powerful feature, allowing projects to grow more than any other of the features on offer. And you van have your own personal profile on github you can show your works 
-	Through Github and similar sites, you will be able to make the project’s code available for people to participate in in terms of development. For example, a person can add a new feature to the project and send you a Pull Request to review the feature. If you like it and find that everything is perfect, you integrate it (Merge) with The project and so on, and this is a great feature that makes all the people who are beneficiaries and users of the project to participate in its development.
- Contributions You can follow all the posts that the team makes in the project to know who the most people participate in Code and you have great statistics so that you can easily evaluate the work team.
